terrible runelite plugins. just started learning so expect terrible quality and brilliant pasting.

**plugins**:
- leviathan *(only automated prayer switching. takes a while to start flicking and might miss a tick on faster attack speeds for some reason)*
- toa-extended *(rdutta's plugin with added in automated prayer switching for akkha, wardens and zebak. no toggle, should be on automatically. haven't even tested this one yet)*

requires ethanapiplugin. chuck the .jar in the sideloaded-plugins folder
