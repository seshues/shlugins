# shlugins
terrible runelite plugins. just started learning so expect terrible quality and brilliant pasting.

**plugins**:
- leviathan *(only automated prayer switching)*
- toa-extended *(rdutta's plugin with added in automated prayer switching for akkha, wardens and zebak. no toggle, should be on automatically. **haven't even tested this one yet**)*

**bugs**:
- leviathan plugin will flick EVERYWHERE when toggled on. takes a few attacks to start working, flick the first ~5 yourself. might miss a tick on faster attack speeds for some reason.

  
requires ethanapiplugin. chuck the .jar in the sideloaded-plugins folder
