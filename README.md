terrible runelite plugins. just started learning so expect terrible quality and brilliant pasting.

**plugins**:
- leviathan *(only automated prayer switching)*
- whisperer *(only automated prayer switching)*
- toa-extended *(rdutta's plugin with added in automated prayer switching for akkha, wardens and zebak. no toggle, should be on automatically. **haven't even tested this one yet**)*

#

**bugs**:  
- leviathan
  - takes ~3 attacks to start working when first toggled on, will not happen again even after toggling the plugin off unless you restart your client. might miss a tick on faster attack speeds for some reason.

requires ethanapiplugin. chuck the .jar in the sideloaded-plugins folder
