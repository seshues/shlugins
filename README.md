terrible runelite plugins. just started learning so expect terrible quality and brilliant pasting.

**plugins**:
- leviathan *(only automated prayer switching)*
- whisperer *(only automated prayer switching)*
- phantom muspah *(only automated prayer switching)*
- toa prayers *(automated prayer switching for akkha, wardens and zebak)*

#

**bugs**:  
- leviathan
  - takes ~3 attacks to start working when first toggled on, will not happen again even after toggling the plugin off unless you restart your client. might miss a tick on faster attack speeds for some reason.
- whisperer
  - most likely has the same issue where it needs the first ~3 projectiles to appear before it starts working as intended
