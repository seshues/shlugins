# shlugins
terrible runelite plugins. just started learning so expect terrible quality and brilliant pasting.

**plugins**:
- leviathan *(only automated prayer switching for now, overlays maybe some day. doesn't seem to keep up with the fastest attack speed and takes a while to start flicking for some reason)*
- toa-extended *(rdutta's plugin with added in automated prayer switching for akkha, warden and zebak. no toggle, should be on automatically. haven't even tested this one yet)*

requires ethanapiplugin. chuck the .jar in the sideloaded-plugins folder
