terrible runelite plugins. just started learning so expect terrible quality and brilliant pasting. 
**likely outdated/unsafe**

**plugins**:
- leviathan *(automated prayer switching)*
- whisperer *(automated prayer switching)*
- phantom muspah *(automated prayer switching)*
- toa prayers *(automated defensive prayer switching for akkha, zebak and warden p2/3)*
- tormented demons *(automated defensive prayer switching, offensives todo)*

#

**bugs**:  
- leviathan
  - takes ~3 attacks to start working when first toggled on, should not happen again until you restart your client. might miss a tick on faster attack speeds for some reason.
- whisperer
  - likely has the same issue as leviathan where it needs the first ~3 projectiles to appear before it starts working as intended
- tormented demons
  - with my very quick test: same as the two above, melee prayer might be slightly delayed?

requires ethanapiplugin. chuck the .jar in the sideloaded-plugins folder
#

**thanks to/credits**:  
- ethan for ethanapiplugin, the utils and his gauntlet plugin.
- pajau for his leviathan plugin that i (think i) improved.
- rdutta for toa-extended.
